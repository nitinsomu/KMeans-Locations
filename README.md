# KMeans-Locations
## A clustering project on location data.
The data points are latitudinal and longitudinal co-ordinates of locations in the USA in place.txt file.
The aim of the project was to group the locations into 3 clusters using K-Means Clustering.

To run this notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitinsomu/KMeans-Locations
```
And run the cells in the clustering.ipynb file sequentially using Shift+Enter.
The results will be stored in a clusters.txt file in the format:
x y
Where x -> the index of the location (0-indexing)
and y -> the cluster group
